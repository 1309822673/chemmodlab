Description: Contains a set of methods for fitting models and methods for
    validating the resulting models. The statistical methodologies comprise
    a comprehensive collection of approaches whose validity and utility have
    been accepted by experts in the Cheminformatics field. As promising new
    methodologies emerge from the statistical and data-mining communities, they
    will be incorporated into the laboratory. These methods are aimed at discovering
    quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). However, the user can
    directly input their own choices of descriptors and responses, so the capability
    for comparing models is effectively unlimited.
