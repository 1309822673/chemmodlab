Description: Contains a set of methods for fitting models and methods for
    validating the resulting models. The statistical methodologies comprise
    a comprehensive collection of approaches whose validity and utility have
    been accepted by experts in the Cheminformatics field. As promising new
    methodologies emerge from the statistical and data-mining communities, they
    will be incorporated into the laboratory. These methods are aimed at discovering
    quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). However, the user can
    directly input their own choices of descriptors and responses, so the capability
    for comparing models is effectively unlimited. Users may also examine the
    diversity of the molecules identified by a QSAR model.
